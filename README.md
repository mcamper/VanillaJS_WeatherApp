# VanillaJS_WeatherApp
Vanilla JavaScript. Goal is to build a functioning Weather Forecast App from the beginning to end by myself. Inspired by a SheCodes challenge.
This project is broken into parts. 
index.html was my initial html, css
form.html and form.js, I added form and event listeners.
MVP form_axios.html and form_axios.js, I added axios and api call for city and temperatures. 
oneday_forecast.html and js goal is to make functional weather description, humidity and wind speed

Goal met. Functioning document. Will now transfer oneday_forecast html and js into index.html and script.ja files and delete other files as they are no longer needed.
