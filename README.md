# VanillaJS_WeatherApp
Vanilla JavaScript. Goal is to build a functioning Weather Forecast App from the beginning to end by myself. Inspired by a SheCodes challenge.
This project is broken into parts.

form.html and form.js, I added form and event listeners.
form_axios.html and form_axios.js, I added axios and api call for city and temperatures.
